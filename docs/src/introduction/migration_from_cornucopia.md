# Migration from Cornucopia
Clorinde is a fork of [Cornucopia](https://github.com/cornucopia-rs/cornucopia) which includes a few breaking changes if you want to migrate over.

## Crate-based code generation
Clorinde generates a *crate* instead of a single file which allows Clorinde to automatically generate a `Cargo.toml` file customised to support all the necessary dependencies and features required by your queries, without polluting your manifest. For example, Cornucopia's ["Full dependencies"](https://cornucopia-rs.netlify.app/book/introduction/dependencies#full-dependencies) example:

```toml
[dependencies]
# Required
postgres-types = { version = "*", features = ["derive"] }

# Async
cornucopia_async = { version = "*", features = ["with-serde_json-1"] }
tokio = { version = "*", features = ["full"] }
tokio-postgres = { version = "*", features = [
    "with-serde_json-1",
    "with-time-0_3",
    "with-uuid-1",
    "with-eui48-1",
] }
futures = "*"
# Async connection pooling
deadpool-postgres = { version = "*" }

# Row serialization
serde = { version = "*", features = ["derive"] }

# Extra types
serde_json = "*"
time = "*"
uuid = "*"
eui48 = "*"
rust_decimal = { version = "*", features = ["db-postgres"] }
```

Could be replaced with:

```toml
[dependencies]
clorinde = { path = "clorinde" }
```

Clorinde also re-exports the dependencies: `postgres`, `tokio-postgres`, and `deadpool-postgres`.

A drawback to crate-based codegen is that `cargo` won't publish crates with path dependencies meaning you either can't publish a crate that depends on Clorinde or you will need to publish the Clorinde crate separately.

If doing the latter, you can use a `clorinde.toml` to specify the `[manifest.package]` section of the `Cargo.toml` in the generated crate. For example, a `clorinde.toml` that includes:

```toml
[manifest.package]
name = "my-clorinde-queries"
version = "0.1.0"
license = "MIT"
homepage = "https://github.com/furina/my-repo"
repository = "https://github.com/furina/my-repo"
publish = true
```

Will generate `clorinde/Cargo.toml` with the specified `[package]` where you can then publish the crate as `my-clorinde-queries`.

## `chrono` instead of `time`
Clorinde uses the `chrono` crate instead of `time`. If you want to keep using `time`, use ["Custom Type Mappings"](../configuration.html#custom-type-mappings) to map the Postgres types to the `time` crate.

```toml
[types.mapping]
"pg_catalog.timestamp" = "time::PrimitiveDateTime"
"pg_catalog.timestamptz" = "time::OffsetDateTime"
"pg_catalog.time" = "time::Time"
"pg_catalog.date" = "time::Date"

[manifest.dependencies]
time = { version = "0.3", features = ["serde"] }
# enable the time feature of postgres and tokio-postgres
postgres = { version = "0.19", features = [
    "with-time-0_3",
    "with-serde_json-1",
] }
tokio-postgres = { version = "0.7", features = [
    "with-time-0_3",
    "with-serde_json-1",
] }
```
